# Multigraphs and applicability
Multigraphs are network representations in which multiple edges and edge loops (self edges) are permitted. These data structures can be either directly observed or aggregated by classifying or cross-classifying node attributes into meta nodes. For the latter case, within group edges correspond to self-edges. See example below where the original graph with 15 nodes and 12 edges (left) is aggregated based on node categories into a small multigraph with 4 nodes (right).

Edge aggregation can also be used to obtain multigraphs. Assume that we study a graph with three different types of relations over three periods of time:

If we aggregate over time periods, we obtain for each edge category a multigraph for the total time period of three days:

For more details see Shafie (2015;2016).

Multigraphs are represented by their edge multiplicity sequence, where the edge multiplicity denotes the number of edges at possible vertex pair sites ordered according to
*(1,1) < (1,2) <···< (1,n) < (2,2) < (2,3) <···< (n,n)*, 
where *n* is number of nodes.

Two probability models for generating undirected random multigraphs are implemented in the package together with several statistics under these two models. Moreover, functions for goodness of fit tests are available for the presented models.

Note that some of the functions are only practical for small scale multigraphs.

## Random multigraph models
The first model is obtained by random stub matching (RSM) given observed degree sequence of a multigraphs, so that edge assignments to vertex pair sites are dependent. The second is obtained by independent edge assignments (IEA) according to a common probability distribution. There are two ways in which an approximate IEA model can be obtained from an RSM model, thus facilitating the structural analysis. These two ways are independent stub assignment (ISA) and independent edge assignment of stubs (IEAS) (Shafie, 2016).

### Example
```{r eval=TRUE}
library('multigraphr')
```
Consider a small graph on 3 nodes and the following adjacency matrix:
```{r adj, include=TRUE, results='markup', message=FALSE}
A <-  matrix(c(1, 1, 0, 
               1, 2, 2, 
               0, 2, 0), 
             nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
A
```
The degree sequence of the multigraph has double counted diagonals (edge stubs for loops) and is given by
```{r degseq, include=TRUE, results='markup', message=FALSE}
D <- get_degree_seq(adj = A, type = 'graph')
D
```
so that number of edges in the multigraph is half the sum of the degree sequence which is equal to 6.

The RSM model given observed degree sequence shows the sample space consists of 7 possible multigraphs, as represented by their multiplicity sequence  `m.seq` (each row correspond to the edge multiplicity sequence of a unique multigraph):
```{r rsm_ex1, include=TRUE, results='markup', message=FALSE}
rsm_1 <- rsm_model(deg.seq = D)
rsm_1$m.seq
```
with probabilities associated with each multigraph, together with statistics 'number of loops', 'number of multiple edges' and 'simple graphs or not':
```{r rsm_ex2, include=TRUE, results='markup', message=FALSE}
rsm_1$prob.dists
```

Consider using the IEA model to approximate the RSM model so that edge assignment probabilities are functions of observed degree sequence. Note that the sample space for multigraphs is much bigger than for the RSM model so the multiplicity sequences are not printed (they can be found using the function `get_edgemultip_seq` for very small multigraphs and their probabilities can be found using the multinomial distribution). The following shows the number of multigraphs under the IEA model:
```{r iea_ex1, include=TRUE, results='markup', message=FALSE}
iea_1 <-   iea_model(adj = A , type = 'graph', K = 0, apx = TRUE)
iea_1$nr.multigraphs
```

## Complexity statistics 
The statistic are complexity statistics such as number of loops (indicator of e.g. homophily) and number of multiple edges (indicator of e.g. multiplexity/interlocking), together with their probability distributions, moments and interval estimates.

### Example (cont'd)
Under the RSM model, the first two moments and interval estimates of the statistics  *M1* = 'number of loops' and *M2* = 'number of multiple edges' are given by
```{r rsm_ex3, include=TRUE, results='markup', message=FALSE}
rsm_1$M
```
which are calculated using the numerically found probability distributions under RSM (no analytical solutions exist for these moments).

Under the IEA model, moments of these statistics, together with the complexity statistic *R_k* representing the sequence of
frequencies of edge sites with multiplicities *0,1,...,k*,  are found using derived formulas:
```{r iea_ex2, include=TRUE, results='markup', message=FALSE}
iea_1$M
iea_1$R
```
The interval estimates can then be visualised to detect discrepancies between observed and expected values thus indicating social mechanisms at play in the generation of edges, and to detect overlap and potential dependencies between different types of edges. 

## Goodness of fit tests
Goodness of fits tests of multigraph models using Pearson (S) and
information divergence (A) test statistics under the random stub matching (RSM)
and by independent edge assignments (IEA) model,
where the latter is either independent edge assignments of stubs (IEAS) or
independent stub assignment (ISA).
The tests are performed using goodness-of-fit measures between the
edge multiplicity sequence of an observed multigraph,
and the expected multiplicity sequence according to a simple or composite hypothesis.

Probability distributions of test statistics, summary of tests, moments of tests statistics,  adjusted test statistics, critical values, significance level according to asymptotic distribution, and power of tests are given.

### Example
Goodness of fit tests for multigraphs with *n=4* nodes and *m=10* edges.

**(1) Testing a simple IEAS hypothesis with degree sequence (6,6,6,2) against a RSM model with degrees (8,8,2,2)**:
```{r gof1, include=TRUE, results='markup', message=FALSE, cache =TRUE}
gof1 <- gof_multigraph(m = 10, model = 'IEAS', deg.mod = c(8,8,2,2), hyp = 'IEAS', deg.hyp = c(6,6,6,2))
gof1$test.summmary
head(gof1$probS, 10) # pdf and cdf for Pearson test statistic S
head(gof1$probA, 10) # pdf and cdf for information divergence statistic A
```

**(2) Testing a correctly specified simple IEAS hypothesis with degree sequence (14,2,2,2)**:
```{r gof2, include=TRUE, results='markup', message=FALSE, cache =TRUE}
gof2 <- gof_multigraph(m = 10, model = 'IEAS', deg.mod = c(14,2,2,2), hyp = 'IEAS', deg.hyp = c(14,2,2,2))
head(gof2$probS, 10) # pdf and cdf for Pearson test statistic S
head(gof2$probA, 10) # pdf and cdf for information divergence statistic A
```
The non-null (`gof1`) and null (`gof2`)  distributions of the test statistics together with their asymptotic chi2-distribution can be visualised using  `ggraph`:
<div class="column">
<img src="man/figures/p1_gof_1.png" width = 380 px/>
<img src="man/figures/p2_gof_2.png" width = 380 px/>
 </div>
**(3) Testing a composite IEAS hypothesis against a RSM model with degree sequence (14,2,2,2)**:
```{r gof3, include=TRUE, results='markup', message=FALSE, cache =TRUE}
gof3 <- gof_multigraph(m = 10, model = 'RSM', deg.mod = c(14,2,2,2), hyp = 'IEAS', deg.hyp = 0)
head(gof3$probS, 10) # pdf and cdf for Pearson test statistic S
head(gof3$probA, 10) # pdf and cdf for information divergence statistic A
```

**(4) Testing a composite ISA hypothesis against a ISA model with degree sequence (14,2,2,2)**:
```{r gof4, include=TRUE, results='markup', message=FALSE, cache =TRUE}
gof4 <- gof_multigraph(m = 10, model = 'ISA', deg.mod = c(14,2,2,2), hyp = 'ISA', deg.hyp = 0)
head(gof4$probS, 10) # pdf and cdf for Pearson test statistic S
head(gof4$probA, 10) # pdf and cdf for information divergence statistic A
```
The non-null (`gof3`) and null (`gof4`)  distributions of the test statistics together can then be visualised as shown above to check their fit to the asymptotic chi2-distribution.
