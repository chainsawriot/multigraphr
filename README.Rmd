# Overview: multigraphs and applicability
Multigraphs are network representations in which multiple edges and edge loops (self edges) are permitted. These data structures can be either directly observed or aggregated by classifying or cross-classifying node attributes into meta nodes. For the latter case, within group edges correspond to self-edges (for more details see Shafie 2015;2016). See example below where the original graph with four node attributes (left) are aggregated into a multigraph (right).

# Package overview: `multigraphr` 
Two probability models for generating undirected random multigraphs are implemented together with several statistics under these two models. Multigraphs are represented by their edge multiplicity sequence, where the edge multiplicity denotes the number of edges at possible vertex pair sites ordered according to
*(1,1) < (1,2) <···< (1,n) < (2,2) < (2,3) <···< (n,n)*, 
where *n* is number of nodes.

Note that some of the functions are only practical for small scale multigraphs.

## Random multigraph models
The first model is obtained by random stub matching (RSM) given observed degree sequence of a multigrpahs, so that edge assignments to vertex pair sites are dependent. The second is obtained by independent edge assignments (IEA) according to a common probability distribution. There are two ways in which an approximate IEA model can be obtained from an RSM model faciliating the ananlysis. These two ways are indepndent stub assignment (ISA) and independent edge assignment of stubs (IEAS) (Shafie 2015;2016).

## Complexity statistics 
The statistic are complexity statistics such as number of loops (indicator of homophily) and number of multiple edges (indicator of multiplexity/interlocking of ties), together with their probability distributions, moments and interval estimates.

## Goodness of fit tests
Goodness of fits tests of multigraph models using Pearson (S) and
information divergence (A) test statistics under the random stub matching (RSM)
and by independent edge assignments (IEA) model,
where the latter is either independent edge assignments of stubs (IEAS) or
independent stub assignment (ISA).
The tests are performed using goodness-of-fit measures between the
edge multiplicity sequence of an observed multigraph,
and the expected multiplicity sequence according to a simple or composite hypothesis.

Porbability distributions of test statistics, summary of tests, moments of tests statistics. adjusted test statistics, critical values, significance level according to asymptotic distribution, and power of tests are given.

```

## Example


## Theoretical Background
`multigraphr` is based on the following published papers. For more details regarding the
theoretical background of the package, consult the following literature:

- Shafie, T. (2015). A multigraph approach to social network analysis. *Journal of Social Structure*, 16. [Link](https://www.exeley.com/journal_of_social_structure/doi/10.21307/joss-2019-011)
- Shafie, T. (2016). Analyzing local and global properties of multigraphs. *The Journal of Mathematical Sociology*, 40(4), 239-264.  [Link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0022250X.2016.1219732?journalCode=gmas20)

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(multigraphr) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
